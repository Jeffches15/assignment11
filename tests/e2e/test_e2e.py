import pytest  # Import the pytest framework for writing and running tests

# The following decorators and functions define E2E tests for the FastAPI calculator application.

# @pytest.mark.e2e is a custom marker used in pytest to label a test as an end-to-end (E2E) test.
# It tags the test so you can:
    # Identify it as an E2E test (i.e. tests that simulate full app usage from the userâ€™s perspective).
    # Run only E2E tests when you want:
        # pytest -m e2e in terminal
    # Exclude E2E tests from a quick test run:
        # pytest -m "not e2e" in terminal
